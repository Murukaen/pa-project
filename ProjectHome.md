## Introduction ##

Welcome to our project! This project consists of building a chess engine compatible with XBoard(v.4.4.x ). The primary purpose of this wiki is enabling the developers to document the project and thus enhance the understanding and the development speed. The key is to commonly agree on the fundamental aspects that will sustain this work.

## What we work with ##

The project will be made integrally in C programming language, consisting of modules(object files),each describing a particular task. To enhance the portability and eventual debugging, the "modulation" will be kept at maximum; each module will accomplish one task and one task only.

## Regulations ##

Even if the main idea is set, we shall admit that the program's evolution implies a lot of change. However we shall agree upon several common sense rules, like coding style for instance.

## Tasks ##

The better the communication, the better the project. Every developer should always know exactly what he/she has to do. It is better to first argue upon a task than later realize that something is totally messed up due to misunderstanding and lack of collaboration.

## Let's get to work ! ##

No time to lose, we have a lot to do. See the ForgeGround to get started.
