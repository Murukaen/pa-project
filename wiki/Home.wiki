== Introduction ==

Welcome to our wiki! This project consists of building a chess engine compatible with XBoard(v.4.4.x ). The primary purpose of this wiki is to enable the developers to document the project and thus enhancing the understanding and the developing speed. The key is to commonly agree to the fundamental aspects that will sustain this work. 

== What we work with ==

The project shall be made integrally in C programming language, consisting of modules(object files) that each describe a particular task. To enhance the portability and eventually debugging the "modulation" will be kept at maximum; each module will accomplish one task and one task good.

== Regulations ==

Even if the main idea is set, we shall admit that program's evolutions implies a lot of change. However we shall agree upon several common sense rules, like coding style for instance. 

== Tasks ==

The better the communication, the better the project. Every developer should always know exactly what he/she has to do. It is better to first argue about a task than realize something is totally messed up due to misunderstanding and lack of collaboration.

== Let's get to work ! ==

No time to lose, we have a lot to do. See the ForgeGround to get started.
